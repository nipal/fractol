The following commands are available to you:
  [32mstatus[0m: Displays the status of your session, including information about
    your current assignment, and the exam history.
  [32mgrademe[0m: Asks the server to grade your current assignment. If you
    have done it right, you will gain the points of the current assignment, go
    up a level, and try the next one. If you fail, however, you will have
    another assignment of the same level to do, and it will potentially bring
    you less points on your grade ... So be sure of yourself before you launch
    this command !
  [32mfinish[0m: Tells the server you are finished with your exam.

You can log out at any time. If this program tells you you earned points,
then they will be counted whatever happens.
